      <description>As gcc needed glibc version 2.29, I started emerging glibc
It said invalid: REDEPEND: USE flag &#39;kernel_linux&#39; referenced in conditional &#39;kernel_linux?&#39; is not in use
So, I added kernel_linux under IUSE_IMPLICIT variable to /etc/portage/make.profile/make.defaults
Similarly as above, Missing USE flag &#39;amd64&#39; So, added amd64 use flag under IUSE_IMPLICIT variable to /etc/portage/make.profile/make.defaults
IUSE_IMPLICIT=&amp;#34;abi_x86_64 prefix prefix-guest kernel_linux amd64&amp;#34; Then, it complained about saying Your /etc/nsswitch.conf is out of date. So, I had to update it.</description>

      <description>After Building and Installing crOS for amd64, i just needed a google account to sign in and was ready to go
crosh is the terminal prompt used by crOS which can be opened by crtl+alt+t and the first warning the shell gave was:
bash: warning: /home/chronos/user/.bash_profile: warning: script from noexec mount; see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/security/noexec_shell_scripts.md
bash: warning: /home/chronos/user/.bashrc: warning: script from noexec mount; see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/security/noexec_shell_scripts.md
CrOS has noexec option in order to reject attempts to execute code as a part of its extremely security.</description>

      <description>This week, I built toolchain for crOS (An acronmyn which I will be referring to ChromiumOS this entire series)
My first attempt was to create binary package for toolchain packages using crossdev
 Create an overlay specifically for crossdev&amp;rsquo;s use  mkdir -p /var/db/repos/crossdev mkdir -p /var/db/repos/crossdev/{profiles,metadata} echo &amp;#39;crossdev&amp;#39; &amp;gt; /var/db/repos/crossdev/profiles/repo_name echo &amp;#39;masters = gentoo&amp;#39; &amp;gt; /var/db/repos/crossdev/metadata/layout.conf chown -R portage:portage /var/db/repos/crossdev  Then instruct portage and crossdev to use this overlay:  #FILE /etc/portage/repos.</description>

      <description>This post is a quick start guide to get the Chromium OS source and build it.
The official guide is at: Developer Guide
These are the steps and commands I used while following the official guide:
Prerequisite: You must have any up-to-date Linux distribution on a x86_64 64-bit system with sudo access to develop Chromium OS (They recommend and offer support to Ubuntu 16.04 - Xenial)  Install git revision control system, the curl download helper, and lvm tools  sudo apt-get install git-core gitk git-gui curl lvm2 \  thin-provisioning-tools python-pkg-resources python-virtualenv \  python-oauth2client xz-utils python3.</description>
