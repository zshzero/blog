Chromium OS, an open-source project that aims to provide a fast, simple, and more secure computing experience for people who spend most of their time on the web and Chromebook is a special-purpose device for a group of users who only care about the web. 

But Portage, the package manager which was originally developed for Gentoo Linux and other tools are used only for cross-compiling and building the filesystem image which makes it a feature-limited OS. 

The goal of this project is to make a full-featured Gentoo-like Chromium OS which combines the Chromebook experience with the flexibility of portage and software packages from Gentoo. 

The idea, in general, is to enhance Chromium OS with the ability to compile and build our favorite file manager, Text editor and email viewer using Protage.
