I am an active member of the Open Source Community called [OSL](https://osl.netlify.app/) which works for the cause of promoting and contributing to Free and Open Source Software.

Having used GNU/Linux for quite some time now and recently I moved to Gentoo. Since then I have been closely following the Gentoo project and participating actively. Also, I have a few [contributions](https://bugs.gentoo.org/buglist.cgi?email2=ashwinkumar3098%40gmail.com&emailassigned_to2=1&emailcc2=1&emaillongdesc2=1&emailreporter2=1&emailtype2=substring&list_id=4514598&query_format=advanced&resolution=---) to the community.

As a hobby project, I have been working on [FridayOS](https://github.com/zshzero/fridayOS) which was done referring to [intermezzOS](https://intermezzos.github.io/). I have contributed to a few [open-source projects](https://github.com/GrayJack/coreutils/pull/70) in the past which include RedoxOS [ion-plugin project](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/ion-plugins/-/merge_requests/7).I have been attending a few Open Source meets with the most prominent being  [Devconf](https://www.devconf.info/in/) and [Open Source India](https://www.opensourceindia.in/).
